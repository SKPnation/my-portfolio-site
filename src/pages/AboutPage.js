                <p>My dream is to one day start my own business and become an entrepreneur (currently working on some ideas).</p>

                <p>I'm constantly learning new things. currently those things include gaining more experience with Swift, React, Express JS, and Node JS</p>

                <p>My latest project, Thesel, is a therapeutic tele-counselling platform for everyone going through various life challenges and seeking solutions.
